attempted logic to avoid repeating displayed images.  Broke original functionality.
Branch lab11-images contains attempt but comitted changes were not committed because of the broken functionality.  Requires redesign.  Likely need to apply more dry principles to get functions clearer for logic.

10/13/2019
The non-repeating of images is complete.  The persistence has been completed for mulitiple surveys.
The results text has been returned to only have votes excluding number of times the image was displayed per requirements.  The chart of results includes bars for both times displayed and times selected.
